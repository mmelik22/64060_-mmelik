# A.	Create a pivot table for the training data with Online as a column variable, CC as a row variable, and Loan as a secondary row variable. The values inside the table should convey the count. In R use functions melto and cast(), or function table(). In Python, use panda dataframe methods melt() and pivot().

melt.UniversalBank = melt(UniversalBank.df,id=c("CreditCard","Personal.Loan"),variable= "Online")
cast.UniversalBank=dcast(melt.UniversalBank,CreditCard+Personal.Loan~Online)
cast.UniversalBank[,c(1:2,14)]

#B.	Consider the task of classifying a customer who owns a bank credi card and is actively using online banking services. Looking at the pivot table, what is the pr ability that this customer will accept the loan offer? [This is the probability of loan acceptanc an = 1) conditional on having a bank credit card (CC 1) and being an active user of online banking services (Online)
#Based on the pivot table, the probability of loan acceptance given the above information is  143/3000 = 4.8% (300=60% of customers, i.e. training set)
```
```{r}
#C.	Create two separate pivot tables for the training data. One will have Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns) and the other will have Loan (rows) as a function of CC. 
library(dplyr)
melt.UniversalBank.Pivot1 = melt(UniversalBank.df,id=c("Personal.Loan"),variable = "Online")
melt.UniversalBank.Pivot2= melt(UniversalBank.df,id=c("CreditCard"),variable = "Online")

#D. Compute the following quantities [P(A I B) means "the probability ofA given B"]:P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors) ii.

#v. 2693/(2693+1827) = 59.58%
#vi. 4520/(4520+480) = 90.40%

#E.	Use the quantities computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability P(Loan = 1 | CC  1, Online = 1).
#(143/(143+337))*(291/(291+189))*(480/(480+4520))*(1327/(1327/3193))*(2693/(2693+1827))*(4520/(4520+480)) = 17.55%?

#F.	Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more accurate estimate?
#The estimate from the pivot table in part B is more accurate.

#G.	Which of the entries in this table are needed for computing P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1)? Run naive Bayes on the data. Examine the model output on training data, and find the entry that corresponds to P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1), Compare this to the number you obtained in (E).
